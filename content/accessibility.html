<p>Accessibility for all is a core belief for Andradge SPPE(Security &amp; Privacy Prioritization Experts), and something we are constantly trying to improve. We acknowledge that adaptations will be needed for individual’s specific needs. We therefore value both your requests and feedback to help us improve via email <a href="mailto:info@andradge.com" class="email">info@andradge.com</a>.</p>
<p>We have split our Accessibility information into the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andradge events hosted through Meetups</li>
<li>Andradge training courses</li>
<li>Andradge website (and blog)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Andradge training courses</h2>
<p>Training courses provided by Andradge SPPE use a number of different technologies and are a mix of lecture, live coding and group work exercises. The following notes may not apply to all training courses, we will provide an accessibility statement for all booked training courses.</p>
<div id="lecture-slides" class="section level3">
<h3>Lecture slides</h3>
<p>Andradge utilises a number of different presentation tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>PowerPoint</li>
<li>RMarkdown</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebooks</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the markup technology allows, alt-text will be provided for all static images.</p>
<div id="rmarkdown" class="section level4">
<h4>RMarkdown</h4>
<p>Jonathan Godfrey has published a set of recommendations for improving the accessibility of content created with RMarkdown, <a href="https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/" class="uri">https://r-resources.massey.ac.nz/rmarkdown/</a>. Andradge commits to following these recommendations.</p>
<p>Note that RMarkdown documents may have <code>htmlwidgets</code> embedded in them. The availability of alt-text in these is dependent on support from the developer/</p>
<p>Please do contact us regarding lecture slide content that is not yet accessible for you and we will endeavour to provide adaptations for your needs.</p>

</div>
<div id="live-codingcode-samples" class="section level3">
<h3>Live coding/code samples</h3>
<p>Andradge exclusively uses the RStudio IDE for R coding and Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment, is a free integrated development environment (IDE) that is included with Anaconda. Unfortunately, it is widely accepted that RStudio is not compatible with the most widely used screen reader tools.</p>
<p>We will provide explicit confirmation that courses make use of technology that fails to support screen readers on both booking pages and booking confirmation emails.</p>
<p>If you have concerns or questions regarding live coding then please do contact us and we can work together to make adaptations for your needs.</p>

<h2>Andradge website (and blog)</h2>
<p>At present, our website remains inaccessible to a large number of individuals. We use Nomensa’s <a href="https://www.accessibilitystatementgenerator.com/">Accessibility Statement Generator</a> for rating our web content. Our aim is for the website to satisfy the conditions for an ‘A’ accessibility grade.</p>
<p>Here are the current issues which prevent us from receiving an ‘A’ grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alt-text is not provided for all non-text content</li>
<li>Not all web pages are provided a title</li>
<li>We have not tested support for keyboard shortcuts</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a Security, Privacy and Risk professional for 15+ yrs providing expertise and analysis to help enhance organizations' security posture and to mitigate risk. As such I use all tenets of Data Science(e.g Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics) for vulnerability remediation prioritization and build actionable insight from that data to move organization to a true SecDevOps for operational efficiency. I founded Andradge SPPE in 2016 to branch out into independent consultancy projects. Please do check out my <a href='../simba-m'>full profile</a>. -->

<h3>
What are the benefits of off-site training?
</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-10">
<ul>
<li>
If your team is distributed across multiple sites it can be really difficult to decide where to hold training on company sites.
<br>
<strong>Dedicated off-site training sites are neutral territory (and Andradge SPPE has <i>lots</i> of hotels nearby üëã)</strong>
</li>
<li>
Re-purposing a conference room at your office for multiple day training courses is often difficult, there‚Äôs a temptation to break the training up over multiple weeks or over lunch.
<br>
<strong>Using a dedicated training space means you can easily book dedicated multi-day courses.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Using a re-purposed conference room in your building is not going to put your team in the mindset to learn, folks may well be distracted thinking about what they‚Äôre usually in the room for.
<br>
<strong>Off-site training helps put your team in the mindset to learn.</strong>
</li>
<li>
Training on-site is often disrupted by colleagues being able to physically barge into rooms and ‚Äújust check one thing.‚Äù
<br>
<strong>Distractions are massively reduced when using a dedicated off-site training space.</strong>

      <description>What are the benefits of off-site training?    If your team is distributed across multiple sites it can be really difficult to decide where to hold training on company sites. Dedicated off-site training sites are neutral territory (and Andradge SPPE has lots of hotels nearby ðŸ‘‹)   Re-purposing a conference room at your office for multiple day training courses is often difficult, thereâ€™s a temptation to break the training up over multiple weeks or over lunch.</description>

      <description>What are the benefits of training at your site?    Itâ€™s difficult to get approval and budget for training at dedicated training centers. Training on your company site means zero expenses for staff accommodation.   Sending staff to dedicated training centers means time lost in transit, and potentially time off in lieu if folks are travelling over the weekend. Training starts and finishes when you need it to.</description>

      <description>These are projects that the folks at Visible Data are currently working on, both within Visible Data and broader afield.
    OxShef: dataviz OxShef: dataviz is an ambitious partnership between University of Oxford and University of Sheffield to promote and support the development of reproducible interactive visualisations for communicating research datasets and outputs. The collaboration was co-founded by Martin John Hadley, Jez Cope, Anna Krystalli, Tim Snow, and Howard Noble.</description>

      <title>reproducibility Ratings for Blogposts</title>

      <guid>/reproducibility-ratings/</guid>
      <description>The top and bottom of all blogposts on this site shows a rating for the reproducibility of the content with the following considerations:
 Is the author citable? Is the data citable? Is the code citable (and replicable)?  The rating system is as follows:
   Not reproducible! Complete lack of unique identifier or programmatic access to resource.      Should be reproducible! A potentially volatile link to the resource has been provided, this includes resources like Gists where commercial interests may make them unavailable in the future.</description>

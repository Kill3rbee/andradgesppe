      <description>At least once a month I’m tasked with something that involves working with DOI, but I’ve never bothered to write a function for extracting these from texts. Time to end that by putting together a tidyversesque add_doi() function!
… wait, why?
The R for Data Science book has lots of excellent advice, including this snippet about reducing duplicated code by writing functions:
So, what are DOI? DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are the gold standard for citations.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to keep secrets. For instance, if you want to use ggmap after July 2018 you need an API key and to provide billing details to Google. You definitely don’t want to accidentally include your personal API key in a blog post.
This blog is generated using the awesome blogdown package, which means all this wonderful stuff is generated from RMarkdown documents that are available in the Github repository visibledata/visibledata.</description>

      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you’ve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good. The ggmap package is used to obtain base maps from the APIs of a number of online mapping tools, the one we care about here is the base maps from Google Maps (because they’re very good).</description>

This Christmas it suddently hit me. There are probably enough festive coffees at Starbucks etc that you could use them to populate a very tasty advent calendar.
In the interests of helping everyone explore the range of Christmassy drinks on offer, I’ll be updating my deposit 24 days of Christmass drinks on Figshare every year from now on.</description>

      <description>Blog items:
Use Projects and here all the time (promotional)
 Use namer
 Pipes are syntactic suger
 Use + NULL in ggplot2
 DOI! Or else. DOI to BIBTEX.
  6 Promotional leaflet, highcharter etc are htmlwidges
Use tidyverse rather than dplyr
 forcats makes life so much easier for reordering ggplot features
 Use stylr and lintr
 Process free-text gender responses with https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gendercoder

   Why document an email signature? Well, there are some interesting features of a signature:

      <description>There are so many awesome folks in the #rstats community that I respect and have learned from over the last 3 years, I owe a lot of my development and growth to the great community behind #rstats. It’s been particularly rewarding and uplifting to read personal stories, conflicts with imposters syndrome and struggles with mental health episodes. There are some particularly inspiring or interesting posts or ideas that I’ve found particularly useful, and will maintain a collection of humans and their stories at the bottom of this post.</description>

      <description>Visible Data is all
It’s extremely important to me to keep things reproducible and woke, here are some promises I commit to:
 Only using public datasets for which a DOI is available. Proprietary munging behind a paywall is acceptable
 Never use gender as a binary variable example (https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/971622753261572096).
 Spell check
 styler
 lintr
 Refuse to work outside of a file synchronisation system

      <description>What are the benefits of off-site training?    If your team is distributed across multiple sites it can be really difficult to decide where to hold training on company sites. Dedicated off-site training sites are neutral territory (and Andradge SPPE has lots of hotels nearby 👋)   Re-purposing a conference room at your office for multiple day training courses is often difficult, there’s a temptation to break the training up over multiple weeks or over lunch.</description>

      <description>What are the benefits of training at your site?    It’s difficult to get approval and budget for training at dedicated training centers. Training on your company site means zero expenses for staff accommodation.   Sending staff to dedicated training centers means time lost in transit, and potentially time off in lieu if folks are travelling over the weekend. Training starts and finishes when you need it to.</description>

      <description>The top and bottom of all blogposts on this site shows a rating for the reproducibility of the content with the following considerations:
 Is the author citable? Is the data citable? Is the code citable (and replicable)?  The rating system is as follows:
   Not reproducible! Complete lack of unique identifier or programmatic access to resource.      Should be reproducible! A potentially volatile link to the resource has been provided, this includes resources like Gists where commercial interests may make them unavailable in the future.</description>

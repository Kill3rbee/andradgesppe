      <description>At least once a month I’m tasked with something that involves working with DOI, but I’ve never bothered to write a function for extracting these from texts. Time to end that by putting together a tidyversesque add_doi() function!
… wait, why?
The R for Data Science book has lots of excellent advice, including this snippet about reducing duplicated code by writing functions:
So, what are DOI? DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are the gold standard for citations.</description>

      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you’ve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good. The ggmap package is used to obtain base maps from the APIs of a number of online mapping tools, the one we care about here is the base maps from Google Maps (because they’re very good).</description>

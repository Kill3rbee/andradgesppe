      <description>At least once a month I’m tasked with something that involves working with DOI, but I’ve never bothered to write a function for extracting these from texts. Time to end that by putting together a tidyversesque add_doi() function!
… wait, why?
The R for Data Science book has lots of excellent advice, including this snippet about reducing duplicated code by writing functions:
So, what are DOI? DOI (Digital Object Identifiers) are the gold standard for citations.</description>

      <description>Sometimes we need to keep secrets. For instance, if you want to use ggmap after July 2018 you need an API key and to provide billing details to Google. You definitely don’t want to accidentally include your personal API key in a blog post.
This blog is generated using the awesome blogdown package, which means all this wonderful stuff is generated from RMarkdown documents that are available in the Github repository visibledata/visibledata.</description>

      <description>ggmap is an awesome package for creating maps with ggplot2. If you’ve seen a nice looking map built with ggplot2 I can almost guarantee you that it uses ggmap to look that good. The ggmap package is used to obtain base maps from the APIs of a number of online mapping tools, the one we care about here is the base maps from Google Maps (because they’re very good).</description>

This Christmas it suddently hit me. There are probably enough festive coffees at Starbucks etc that you could use them to populate a very tasty advent calendar.
In the interests of helping everyone explore the range of Christmassy drinks on offer, I’ll be updating my deposit 24 days of Christmass drinks on Figshare every year from now on.</description>

Use Projects and here all the time (promotional)
 Use namer
 Pipes are syntactic suger
 Use + NULL in ggplot2
 DOI! Or else. DOI to BIBTEX.
  6 Promotional leaflet, highcharter etc are htmlwidges
Use tidyverse rather than dplyr
 forcats makes life so much easier for reordering ggplot features
 Use stylr and lintr
 Process free-text gender responses with https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gendercoder

      <description>Content Warning: This is a navel gazing branding/workflow post.  Recently, Visible Data started using a fairly profesh looking signature in our emails. Each signature includes a link to the consultant’s availability via the excellent FreeBusy service.
   Why document an email signature? Well, there are some interesting features of a signature:
 Share Google Calendar free/busy availability via FreeBusy [Read more…]

      <description>There are so many awesome folks in the #rstats community that I respect and have learned from over the last 3 years, I owe a lot of my development and growth to the great community behind #rstats. It’s been particularly rewarding and uplifting to read personal stories, conflicts with imposters syndrome and struggles with mental health episodes. There are some particularly inspiring or interesting posts or ideas that I’ve found particularly useful, and will maintain a collection of humans and their stories at the bottom of this post.</description>

      <description>Visible Data is all
It’s extremely important to me to keep things reproducible and woke, here are some promises I commit to:
 Only using public datasets for which a DOI is available. Proprietary munging behind a paywall is acceptable
 Never use gender as a binary variable example (https://twitter.com/polesasunder/status/971622753261572096).
 Spell check
 styler
 lintr
 Refuse to work outside of a file synchronisation system
  Appearance  Responsive iframes!</description>

 The post is interesting and has something unique to it The post is easy to understand and both analyses and data visualisations follow sensible best practices The code is fully reproducible with all datasets available programmatically to folks replicating the code The author doesn’t give up writing because one of these can’t easily be met  In an ideal world, datasets are provided with DOI and/or else easily accessible via an API.</description>
